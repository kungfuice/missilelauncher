Missile Launcher controls USB Missile Launchers using a gtk+ interface.  This application has been designed specifically to control the http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/warfare/8a0f/, Dream Cheeky USB Missile Launcher, however it may be extended to include other USB launchers.

There are plans to add webcam support, and automated target tracking, so check back for updates.

This is still alpha software
